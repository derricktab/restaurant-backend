## Prerequisites

git clone <your-backend-repo-url>
cd <your-backend-directory>
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
node server.js
```

By default, the server will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You can access the API endpoints at this base URL.

## Endpoints

The server provides the following RESTful endpoints:

- `GET /restaurants`: Fetches a list of all restaurants.

- `PUT /restaurants/:id`: Updates an existing restaurant.
- `DELETE /restaurants/:id`: Deletes a restaurant.
